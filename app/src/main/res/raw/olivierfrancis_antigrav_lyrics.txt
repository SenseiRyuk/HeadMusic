[Intro: Utada Hikaru]
You're giving me
Too many things lately
You're all I need
You smiled at me and said

[Chorus]
I'm just tryna smoke my dope, watch anime, yeah
Pull up in that candy paint, I'm switching lanes, yeah
Yellow gold all on my chain, look like lemonade, yeah
Pull up with some hentai girls to Raising Cane's, ooh
All I rock is Suicokes and Bathing Apes, yeah
I been smokin' purple dope, sippin' Gatorade, yeah
They gon' talk behind your back, not to your face, yeah
Pull up with some hentai girls, 'cause they my fave, ooh
I'm just tryna smoke my dope, watch anime, yeah
Pull up in that candy paint, I'm switching lanes, yeah
Yellow gold all on my chain, look like lemonade, yeah
Pull up with some hentai girls to Raising Cane's, oh
All I rock is Suicokes and Bathing Apes, yeah
I been smokin' purple dope, sippin' Gatorade, yeah
They gon' talk behind your back, not to your face, yeah
Pull up with some hentai girls, 'cause they my fave, ooh

[Verse]
Hentai girl, hop on it, download and upload it
Pull up in that hovercraft, we movin' supersonic
Hentai girl, I love it, all my limbs bionic
Burnin' through the atmosphere, my Backwood like a comet
I skrt off in a hurry, Jet Set Radio fury
When I'm gone off the Henny, that shit got my vision blurry
Anti-gravity Audi, keep my day ones around me
Both these middle fingers up, fuck anybody that doubt me
I watch the lightning in the sky, yeah
Kick this shit in overdrive, do or die, yeah
I had to check the air supply, we gon' ride, yeah, yeah
Movin' at the speed of light, gettin' fried, yeah, yeah
See me movin' through the night, yeah
The whip anti-grav', that's how I'm pullin' up
I'm underwater, just might spark the blunt
I got some money but it's not enough
Hentai girl, know that I need your love, ayy

[Chorus]
I'm just tryna smoke my dope, watch anime, yeah
Pull up in that candy paint, I'm switching lanes, yeah
Yellow gold all on my chain, look like lemonade, yeah
Pull up with some hentai girls to Raising Cane's, ooh
All I rock is Suicokes and Bathing Apes, yeah
I been smokin' purple dope, sippin' Gatorade, yeah
They gon' talk behind your back, not to your face, yeah
Pull up with some hentai girls, 'cause they my fave, ooh
I'm just tryna smoke my dope, watch anime, yeah
Pull up in that candy paint, I'm switching lanes, yeah
Yellow gold all on my chain, look like lemonade, yeah
Pull up with some hentai girls to Raising Cane's, ooh
All I rock is Suicokes and Bathing Apes, yeah
I been smokin' purple dope, sippin' Gatorade, yeah
They gon' talk behind your back, not to your face, yeah
Pull up with some hentai girls, 'cause they my fave, ooh

[Outro]
I'm just tryna smoke my dope
I'm, I'm just tryna smoke my dope, watch anime, yeah
I'm just tryna smoke my dope
I'm, I'm just tryna smoke my dope, watch anime, yeah
