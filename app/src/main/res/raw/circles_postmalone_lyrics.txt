Hey, hey, hey, hey
Oh,  oh, oh-oh
Oh,  oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh


We couldn't turn around
'Til  we were upside down
I'll  be the bad guy now
But no, it ain't too hard
I  couldn't be there
Even when I try
You don't believe it
We do this every time

Seasons  change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go
Run away but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away, oh


I got a feeling it's time to let go
If you say so
I knew that this was new for me, ayy
You thought that it was special, special
But it was just the sex though, the sex though
And I still hear the echoes (The echoes)
I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go

Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go
Run away but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away but we're running in circles

Run away, run away, run away

Maybe you don't understand what I'm going through
It's only me, what you got to lose?
Make up your mind, tell me what are you gonna do
It's only me, let it go

Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go
Run away but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away


I think your love would be too much
Or you'll be left in the dust
Unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower
You're the sunflower
Yeah
