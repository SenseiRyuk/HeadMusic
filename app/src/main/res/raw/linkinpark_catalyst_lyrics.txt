[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
God bless us everyone
We're a broken people living under loaded gun
And it can't be outfought
It can't be outdone
It can't be outmatched
It can't be outrun, no!
God bless us everyone
We're a broken people living under loaded gun
And it can't be outfought
It can't be outdone
It can't be outmatched
It can't be outrun, no!

[Pre-Chorus 1: Chester Bennington and Mike]
And when I close my eyes tonight
To symphonies of blinding light!
God bless us everyone
We're a broken people living under loaded gun

[Chorus: Chester]
Oh, like memories in cold decay
Transmissions echoing away
Far from the world of you and I
Where oceans bleed into the sky!

[Verse 2: Chester]
God save us everyone
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns?
For the sins of our hand
The sins of our tongue
The sins of our father
The sins of our young? No!
God save us everyone
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns?
For the sins of our hand
The sins of our tongue
The sins of our father
The sins of our young? No!

[Pre-Chorus 2: Chester and Mike]
And when I close my eyes tonight
To symphonies of blinding light!
God save us everyone
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns?

[Chorus: Chester]
Oh, like memories in cold decay
Transmissions echoing away
Far from the world of you and I
Where oceans bleed into the sky!

[Keyboard Solo]

[Chorus: Chester]
Oh, like memories in cold decay
Transmissions echoing away
Far from the world of you and I
Where oceans bleed into the sky!

[Bridge: Chester and Mike]
Lift me up, let me go
Lift me up, let me go
Lift me up, let me go
Lift me up, let me go
Lift me up, let me go
Lift me up, let me go
Lift me up, let me go
Lift me up, let me go
Lift me up, let me go

[Bridge: Mike]
It can't be outfought
It can't be outdone
It can't be outmatched
It can't be outrun, no!
God bless us everyone
We're a broken people living under loaded gun
And it can't be outfought
It can't be outdone
It can't be outmatched
It can't be outrun, no!
God bless us everyone
We're a broken people living under loaded gun
And it can't be outfought
It can't be outdone
It can't be outmatched
It can't be outrun
