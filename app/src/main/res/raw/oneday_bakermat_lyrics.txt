I have a dream
That one day
This nation will rise up
And live out the true meaning of its creed


We hold these truths to be self-evident
That all men are created equal

I have a dream
That one day on the red hills of Georgia
The sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners
Will be able to sit together
At the table of brotherhood
I have a dream one day

One day
This nation will rise up
And live out the true meaning of its creed

I have a dream
That one day on the red hills of georgia
The sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners

Will be able to sit together
At the table of brotherhood
I have a dream one day
