[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I ain't taking nothing but wins
Bitch, I just copped me a Benz
Next I'm gon' cop me a Porsche
I turn the beat to a corpse
Bitch, I'm all over from CoMo to London, LA to New York
You versus me, that's a joke
I keeps it real, you a hoax
Shawty gon' roll up my dope
Hop out my car full of smoke
Act like you feel me but lil' boy, you broke (Yeah)
Pull up on you in that Aston
Hit the blunt and flick the ashes
Keep a Tommy duffle bag with hunnids in it
Polo pony, horses in my engine, vicious
Shift and hit the swisher, yeah
Ain't nobody fly as us
Smokin' all damn day, gettin' high as us, yeah
I take the weed and I grind it up
Yeah, I stepped in the spot lookin' fly as fuck (Yeah)

[Chorus]
In my Old Skool Vans with my socks pulled up
Girls gon' flock when the clique show up
Champagne popped, got the weed rolled up
Step in the spot, all eyes on us
Big bands and the high-top Chucks
'Bout damn time that the team blow up
Step in the spot, all eyes on us
Step in the spot, all eyes on us

[Refrain]
Old Skool Vans with my socks pulled up, ayy, yeah
With my socks pulled up, ahh yeah, ahh yeah
With my socks pulled up, ahh yeah
Yeah

[Verse 2]
All I rock, designer shit
Chillin' with the finest bitch
We just gettin' high as shit
Ayy, shawty got me back to my rockstar ways
Blowin' on the pack feelin' all so paid
I'ma do the dash and dip (Yeah)
Keep the marijuana lit
Now I got the diamond wrist
Every night, I'm in paradise
XL white tee and a pair of Nikes
O-o-ocean spray, I got the juice
Switchin' lanes and drop the roof
Nowadays, I got a bag with money in it
Seems to me that all the kids is fuckin' with us
You ain't fuckin' with us
Ain't nobody fly as us
In a two door Porsche, come ride with us, yeah
I take the weed and I light it up
Yeah, I stepped in the spot lookin' fly as fuck

[Chorus]
In my Old Skool Vans with my socks pulled up
Girls gon' flock when the clique show up
Champagne popped, got the weed rolled up
Step in the spot, all eyes on us
Big bands and the high-top Chucks
'Bout damn time that the team blow up
Step in the spot, all eyes on us
Step in the spot, all eyes on us

[Refrain]
Old Skool Vans with my socks pulled up, ayy, yeah
With my socks pulled up, ahh yeah, ahh yeah
With my socks pulled up, ahh yeah
Yeah
